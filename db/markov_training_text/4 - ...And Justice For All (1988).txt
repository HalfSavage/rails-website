winter it will send
throwing all you see
into obscurity
death of mother earth
never a rebirth
evolution's end
never will it mend
never

fire
to begin whipping dance of the dead
blackened is the end
to begin whipping dance of the dead
color our world blackened

blistering of earth
terminate its worth
deadly nicotine
kills what might have been
callous frigid chill
nothing left to kill
never seen before
breathing nevermore
never

fire
to begin whipping dance of the dead
blackened is the end
to begin whipping dance of the dead
color our world blackened

blackened

opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
darkest color
blistered earth
true death of life
termination....expiration...cancellation...human race
expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
see our mother
put to death
see our mother die
smoldering decay
take her breath away
millions of our years
in minutes disappears
darkening in vain
decadence remains
all is said and done
never is the sun
never

fire
to begin whipping dance of the dead
blackened is the end
to begin whipping dance of the dead
fire
is the outcome of hypocrisy
darkest potency
in the exit of humanity
color our world blackened
blackened

halls of justice painted green
money talking
power wolves beset your door
hear them stalking
soon you'll please their appetite
they devour
hammer of justice crushes you
overpower

the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i can't believe the things you say
i can't believe
i can't believe the price you pay
nothing can save you

justice is lost
justice is raped
justice is gone
pulling your strings
justice is done
seeking no truth
winning is all
find it so grim
so true
so real

apathy their stepping stone
so unfeeling
hidden deep animosity
so deceiving
through your eyes their light burns
hoping to find
inquisition sinking you
with prying minds

the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i can't believe the things you say
i can't believe
i can't believe the price you pay
nothing can save you

justice is lost
justice is raped
justice is gone
pulling your strings
justice is done
seeking no truth
winning is all
find it so grim
so true
so real

lady justice has been raped
truth assassin
rolls of red tape seal your lips
now you're done in
their money tips her scales again
make your deal
just what is truth? i cannot tell
cannot feel

the ultimate in vanity
exploiting their supremacy
i can't believe the things you say
i can't believe
i can't believe the price we pay
nothing can save us

justice is lost
justice is raped
justice is gone
pulling your strings
justice is done
seeking no truth
winning is all
find it so grim
so true
so real
seeking no truth
winning is all
find it so grim
so true
so real

do you see what i see?
truth is an offense
you silence for your confidence
do you hear what i hear?
doors are slamming shut
limit your imagination, keep you where they must
do you feel what i feel?
bittering distress
who decides what you express
do you take what i take?
endurance is the word
moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

doesn't matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if it's done just how i say

independence limited
freedom of choice
choice is made for you my friend
freedom of speech
speech is words that they will bend
freedom with their exception

do you fear what i fear?
living properly
truths to you are lies to me
do you choose what i choose?
more alternatives
energy derives from both the plus and negative
do you need what i need?
boundaries overthrown
look inside to each his own
do you trust what i trust?
me, myself and i
penetrate the smoke screen i see through the selfish lie

doesn't matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if it's done just how i say

independence limited
freedom of choice
choice is made for you my friend
freedom of speech
speech is words that they will bend
freedom with their exception

do you know what i know?
your money and your wealth
your silence just to hear your self
do you want what i want?
desire not a thing
i hunger after independence lengthen freedom's ring

doesn't matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if it's done just how i say

independence limited
freedom of choice
choice is made for you my friend
freedom of speech
speech is words that they will bend
freedom no longer frees you

doesn't matter what you see
or into it what you read
you can do it your own way
if it's done just how i say


i can't remember anything
can't tell if this is true or dream
deep down inside i feel to scream
this terrible silence stops me
now that the war is through with me
i'm waking up i can not see
that there's not much left of me
nothing is real but pain now

hold my breath as i wish for death
oh please god,wake me

back in the womb its much too real
in pumps life that i must feel
but can't look forward to reveal
look to the time when i'll live
fed through the tube that sticks in me
just like a wartime novelty
tied to machines that make me be
cut this life off from me

hold my breath as i wish for death
oh please god,wake me

now the world is gone i'm just one
oh god,help me hold my breath as i wish for death
oh please god help me

darkness

imprisoning me
all that i see
absolute horror
i cannot live
i cannot die
trapped in myself
body my holding cell

landmine

has taken my sight
taken my speech
taken my hearing
taken my arms
taken my legs
taken my soul
left me with life in hell


suspicion is your name
your honesty to blame
put dignity to shame
dishonor
witchhunt modern day
determining decay
the blatant disarray
disfigure
the public eyes' disgrace
defying common place
unending paper chase
unending
deafening
painstaking
reckoning
this vertigo it doth bring

shortest straw
challenge liberty
downed by law
live in infamy
rub you raw
witchhunt riding through
shortest straw
this shortest straw has been pulled for you

pulled for you
shortest straw
pulled for you
shortest straw
pulled for you
shortest straw
shortest straw has been pulled for you

the accusations fly
discrimination, why?
your inner self to die
intruding
doubt sunk itself in you
it's teeth and talons through
your living catch 22
deluding
a mass hysteria
a megalomania
reveal dementia
reveal
secretly
silently
certainly
in vertigo you will be

shortest straw
challenge liberty
downed by law
live in infamy
rub you raw
witchhunt riding through
shortest straw
this shortest straw has been pulled for you

pulled for you

behind you, hands are tied
your being, ostracized
your hell is multiplied
upending
the fallout has begun
oppressive damage done
your many turned to none
to nothing
you're reaching your nadir
your will has disappeared
the lie is crystal clear
defending
channels red
one word said
blacklisted
with vertigo make you dead

shortest straw
challenge liberty
downed by law
live in infamy
rub you raw
witchhunt riding through
shortest straw
this shortest straw has been pulled for you
pulled for you


my life suffocates
planting seeds of hate
i've loved, turned to hate
trapped far beyond my fate
i give
you take
this life that i forsake
been cheated of my youth
you turned this lie to truth

anger
misery
you'll suffer unto me

harvester of sorrow
language of the mad
harvester of sorrow

pure black looking clear
my work is done soon here
try getting back to me
get back which used to be
drink up
shoot in
let the beatings begin
distributor of pain
your loss becomes my gain

anger
misery
you'll suffer unto me

harvester of sorrow
language of the mad
harvester of sorrow

all have said their prayers
invade their nightmares
see into my eyes
you'll find where murder lies

infanticide

harvester of sorrow
language of the mad
harvester of sorrow
language of the mad
harvester of sorrow

never hunger
never prosper
i have fallen prey to failure
struggle within
triggered again
now the candle burns at both ends
twisting under schizophrenia
falling deep into dementia

old habits reappear
fighting the fear of fear
growing conspiracy
everyone's after me
frayed ends of sanity
hear them calling
hear them calling me

birth of terror
death of much more
i'm the slave of fear,my captor
never warnings
spreading its wings
as i wait for the horror she brings
loss of interest,question,wonder
waves of fear they pull me under

old habits reappear
fighting the fear of fear
growing conspiracy
everyone's after me
frayed ends of sanity
hear them calling
hear them calling me

into ruin
i am sinking
hostage of this nameless feeling
hell is set free
flooded i'll be
feel the undertow inside me
height,hell,time,haste,terror,tension
life,death,want,waste,mass depression

old habits reappear
fighting the fear of fear
growing conspiracy
myself is after me
frayed ends of sanity
hear them calling
frayed ends of sanity
hear them calling
hear them calling me

when a man lies he murders
some part of the world
these are the pale deaths which
men miscall their lives
all this i cannot bear
to witness any longer
cannot the kingdom of salvation
take me home


dear mother
dear father
what is this hell you have put me through
believer
deceiver
day in day out live my life through you
pushed onto me what's wrong or right
hidden from this thing that they call life
dear mother
dear father
every thought i'd think you'd disapprove
curator
dictator
always censoring my every move
children are seen but are not heard
tear out everything inspired

innocence
torn from me without your shelter
barred reality
i'm living blindly

dear mother
dear father
time has frozen still what's left to be
hear nothing
say nothing
cannot face the fact i think for me
no guarantee,it's life as is
but damn you for not giving me my chance
dear mother
dear father
you've clipped my wings before i learned to fly
unspoiled
unspoken
i've outgrown that fucking lullaby
same thing i've always heard from you
do as i say not as i do

innocence
torn from me without your shelter
barred reality
i'm living blindly
i'm in hell without you
cannot cope without you two
shocked at the world that i see
innocent victim please rescue me

dear mother
dear father
hidden in your world you've made for me
i'm seething
i'm bleeding
ripping wounds in me that never heal
undying spite i feel for you
living out this hell you always knew.
